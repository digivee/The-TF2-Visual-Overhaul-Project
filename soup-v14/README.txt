Hi! Thanks for downloading SOUP v1.5! This is a spiritual part 2 to SOUP v1.4, and a literal number upgrade to v1.3 (by two numbers!).

This release includes 6 new main menu renders and a whole lot of fixes to the previous version. Next update will include zombies (probably) and new stuff. That's the Sloofy guarantee; being incredibly vague while promising nearly nothing!

LICENSE STUFF

As for license stuff, you are free to modify, distribute and commercialize (your own modded version of SOUP); and include any part of SOUP into your own mods. However, I stress that you should credit myself and all of the art asset authors I borrowed from. Attributions must be attached to whatever you are doing publicly. However, you are not allowed to redistribute SOUP as-is. Everything else, go wild.
