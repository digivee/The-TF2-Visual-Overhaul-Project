# The TF2 Visual Overhaul Project
A collection of mods designed to enhance TF2's graphics and sounds without stepping on valves original artistic vision.

# Things to note before installing
This pack will most likely not work on VALVe servers, as most of them run sv_pure 1 to combat against XRAY cheats.

This pack might be prone to crashing, in which case, please make an issue so I can solve it as quickly as possible.

This pack doesn't include Hi-Poly/SFM player models because they tend to clip with most arm cosmetics.

I didn't create the vast majority of these mods, and a credits list can be found in credits.txt. Most of these mods have been released on gamebanana under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license, meaning I am free to redistribute these files, without editing them. If your mod is in here, and you wish to contact me, feel free to create an issue or contact me directly on discord at Digivee#6205.
